# BUSINESS INTELLIGENCE AND STOCK PREDICTION PROJECT

This project aims at testing the real-world application of Data Analytics as well as how we represent data for audiences. Rather than the conventional format, this project acts as an umbrella project which encompasses in itself two distinct tasks.

The "BUSINESS INTELLIGENCE AND STOCK PREDICTION" Project contains 2 separate Sub Projects as follows:-
1. Stock Trend Prediction (Web Application using Python & Streamlit)
2. Global Super Store Dashboard for Business Intelligence (BI Dashboards using PowerBI & Tableau)
